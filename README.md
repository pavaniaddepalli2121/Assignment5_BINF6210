Microbiome Analysis of the Distal Lumen and Proximal Mucosa in the Human Gut: Comparative Study of Microbial Diversity and Community Composition
Project Structure
1. data/:
reference.fasta: The reference file containing the taxonomy information used for analysis.
DL_sequences.fasta: FASTA file for sequences from the Distal Lumen.
PM_sequences.fasta: FASTA file for sequences from the Proximal Mucosa.

2. scripts/:
analysis_script.R: Main R script containing the code for analyzing the 16S rRNA sequences from the human gut microbiome.
functions.R: Supporting functions used in the main analysis script.
create_figures.R: Script for generating the bar plots and diversity index figures.
### Results and Discussion ------

# Higher OTU Richness in sa1: The distal lumen (sa1) shows significantly greater observed OTU richness compared to the proximal mucosa (sa2), suggesting higher microbial diversity.

# Shannon Index Confirms Diversity: The Shannon diversity index  further supports this finding, indicating a more evenly distributed and diverse microbial community in sa1.

# Influencing Factors: Environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, nutrient availability) and methodological differences in DNA extraction and sequencing likely contribute to the observed variations (Xue et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2022; Patel & Shah, 2019).
